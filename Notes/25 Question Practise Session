12.A neon number is a number where the sum of digits of the square of the number is equal to the number.
   Input  : 9
Output : Given number  9 is Neon number

Explanation : square of 9=9*9=81;
              sum of digit of square : 8+1=9(which is equal to given number)

13.For a given positive integer N, the purpose is to find the value of F2 + F4 + F6 +………+ F2n till N number. Where Fi indicates the i’th Fibonacci number.
   Input: n = 4
Output: 33
N = 4, So here the fibonacci series will be produced from 0th term till 8th term:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
Sum of numbers at even indexes = 0 + 1 + 3 + 8 + 21 = 33.

Input: n = 7
Output: 609
0 + 1 + 3 + 8 + 21 + 55 + 144 + 377 = 609.

15. Given a sorted array of distinct elements, the task is to find the summation of absolute differences of all pairs in the given array.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 10
Sum of |2-1| + |3-1| + |4-1| +
       |3-2| + |4-2| + |4-3| = 10

16.Given an integer array A[] and a character array B[] of equal lengths where every character of the array is from the set {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’}. Elements of both arrays are associated with each other i.e. the value of B[i] is linked to A[i] for all valid values of i. The task is to find the value min(a + b, c).

Examples:

Input: A[] = {3, 6, 4, 5, 6}, B[] = {‘a’, ‘c’, ‘b’, ‘b’, ‘a’}
Output: 6


Input: A[] = {4, 2, 6, 2, 3}, B[] = {‘b’, ‘a’, ‘c’, ‘a’, ‘b’}
Output: 5

17 . Given an array of integers, update every element with the multiplication of previous and next elements with the following exceptions.

a) The First element is replaced by the multiplication of the first and second.
b) The last element is replaced by multiplication of the last and second last.

Example:

Input  : arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Output : arr[] = {6, 8, 15, 24, 30}

18. We are given an array of Integers. We have to perform the following operation on the array until it is fully exhausted.

Select the max number in the array and delete that number including all the numbers to its right side in the array.
Repeat the step 1 for the left elements of the array i.e select the maximum element in the left elements  and delete it including all numbers to its right.
Our task is to simulate the above procedure and return the number of steps that will be taken until the first element(index 0) of the array is also deleted and array is said to be exhausted.

Input : Array = [2, 3, 5, 4, 1]
Output : Steps Taken: 3
Explanation: Step 1: Remove 5 and elements to its right
             so, Array becomes [2, 3]
             Step 2: Remove 3 as it is the maximum and
             right most already so, Array becomes [2]
             Step 3: Remove 2 and the array becomes EMPTY
             Hence, at the end of step 3 the array stands
             exhausted.

19. Frequency of element in array.

20.Given an array of even size, task is to find minimum value that can be added to an element so that array become balanced.
An array is balanced if the sum of the left half of the array elements is equal to the sum of right half. Suppose, we have an array 1 3 1 2 4 3.
The Sum of first three elements is 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 and sum of last three elements is 2 + 4 + 3 = 9
So this is unbalanced, to make it balanced the minimum number we can add is 4 to any element in first half.

Examples :

Input : 1 2 1 2 1 3
Output : 2
Sum of first 3 elements is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4,
sum of last three elements is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6
To make the array balanced you can add 2.

Input : 20 10
Output : 10
