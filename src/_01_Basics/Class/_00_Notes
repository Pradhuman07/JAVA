SHORTCUTS:-

        run                   = alt + r

        open/close explorer   = alt + 1
        close panel tab       = ctrl + j

        format code           = alt + f
        word wrap             = alt + w

        close tabs            = ctrl + f4
        rename                = f2

float a = 4;   //no error since 4 is a integer and integer can be stored in float
float a=4.0;   //error...as 4.0 is double and double cannot be stored in float

--int/int will always yields int (even if you store it in double) (if you want ans in point then make any of a or b ine expression a/b float/double)

long x = 999_999_999_999_999;

a%b --> (0,b-1)
Eg:- something%3 = 0,1,2    [let something = 3,4,5,6,7 ...now check]

if Nr<Dr then Nr%Dr=Nr always
