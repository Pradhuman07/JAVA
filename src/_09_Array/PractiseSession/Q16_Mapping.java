//import javax.lang.model.util.Elements;16.Given an integer array A[] and a character array B[] of equal lengths where every character of the array is from the set {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’}. Elements of both arrays are associated with each other i.e. the value of B[i] is linked to A[i] for all valid values of i. The task is to find the value min(a + b, c).

//Examples:

//Input: A[] = {3, 6, 4, 5, 6}, B[] = {‘a’, ‘c’, ‘b’, ‘b’, ‘a’}
//Output: 6

//Input: A[] = {4, 2, 6, 2, 3}, B[] = {‘b’, ‘a’, ‘c’, ‘a’, ‘b’}
//Output: 5
