    --Can achieve total abstraction and Multiple inheritance
    --Interface define contracts, which implementing classes need to honor.
    --By default all methods are public and abstract
    --It means that methods can only be declared.
    --implements keyword

--Extends & Implements keyword

--Class does not have multiple inheritance while Interface has
